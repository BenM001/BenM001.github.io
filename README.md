# BenM001.github.io
Hi, my name is Benjamin Molnar and my email address is bmolnar@mywaketech.edu
My GitHub username is BenM001, and I'm new to GitHub. My account doesn't have a lot of personalization and I don't have any other repositories created.
This repository was created for the college course CTI-110. So far, it only contains this README.md file, and the files history.
In order to clone the repository onto my machine, I first had to create an account and the repository. I created my username (BenM001) and the repository (BenM001.github.io). Then I downloaded the GitHub Desktop Application and started cloning the repository. I had to change the file path to go to a GitHub folder that I created, but other then that, I simply had to press a button to clone the repository.
